        <p>
          Dear Noohath,
          <br>
          I'm sorry i have'nt emailed you in ages, as you may have heard I've been busy with school axtra-curricular activities lately. I am writing to tell you about the last activity organised under Greener Thinadhoo project, whiihc involves almost
          every citizen.
          <br>
          we started early morning before sunrise, which may sound inconvenient, however I assure you it was refeshing to inhale the crisp early morning air. We were devided into groups of fifteen and were instructed to clean a certain area, and in
          our case it was the local park. Thankfully some of my my neighbours and classmates were present. I was elated to reunite with them
          with utmost cooperation we were done cleaning our area in no time. the next task was to do some repairs to the demages done over time to the ark and planting new trees. the main reason of planting new trees was to attract as many citizens
          especially the dependent portion of the community. We also cleaned the ponds by fishing out some lastic using a pole and a net.
          <br>
          In my opinion, these kind of activites are the most essential key for a community to remain as one. it benefits everyone and i encourage your work.
          <br>
          Love,  <br>
          Shany.
